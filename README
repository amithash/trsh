A safe rm.

I wrote this script when I accidentally deleted my homework.

SETUP
--
./install.pl -u
for a user install.
sudo ./install.pl # or ./install.pl as root
for a full system install.

The difference between a user install and a full system install is that in a
full system install trsh is installed for all user and hence must be performed
as root. This is not needed for a user install and the installation will be
local to the user's home directory. (Helpful if you do not have permissions).

MANUAL METHOD:

If the above does not work, probably you do not use either of the supported
shells (C-SHELL or its deveravatives or BASH), or you wanted your own aliases
or you wanted to place the files in non default locations.


1. copy the trsh.pl to where ever you want,
I usually copy it to my home directory and rename it to .trsh.pl
so I do not see it or to my /usr/bin dir which is in the path.

edit your .Xrc file (for bash it is .bashrc, and the examples are for bash)
alias rm='~/.trsh.pl'
alias undo='~/.trsh.pl -u'

TEST
--

First of all, before using trsh, due to the nature of its dependency,
Run tests test-trsh.sh and if any fail, raise a bug and DO NOT USE any further.

I understand that this is under the GNU license, and I am not responsible 
for your data loss, but still, does not mean that I cannot feel bad if
my program ate your system! 


USAGE
--
rm [OPTIONS]... [FILES]...

FILES:
This is a list of files to recover or delete.

OPTIONS:

-u|--undo [FILES | NUMBER]
This option instructs trsh to recover FILES from the trash and place them into the current working directory.
If FILES is not provided, the last deleted file is recovered and placed into the current working directory.
If instead a number is provided as an option, that many undo's are performed. 

-f|--force
This option instructs trsh to permanently delete FILES and completely bypass the trash

-i|--interactively
This option will instruct trsh to prompt the user before deleting each and every file.

-v|--verbose
This option will instruct trsh to talk about whatever it is doing.

-e|--empty
This empties the trash.

-r|--recursive
This option if provided will allow directories to be deleted.

-l|--list
This will display the contents of the trash.

-s|--size
This displays the size of the Trash directory. 

-h|--help
Displays this help and exits.

rm FILES just moves FILES to the trash. By default, directories are not deleted.

NOTES
--

If multiple files of the same name are deleted, they are stored in the trash as if it were a stack.
Thus any recover will be like popping the files from the trash stack! 

KNOWN ISSUES
--
If a file has exactly 6 consecutive underscores, then bad things will happen! :-)
That is if a file is named: SOMETHING______SOMETHING,. You are better 
off deleting this forcefully!
