A safe rm.

MOTIVATION
--

I wrote this script when I accidentally deleted my homework. Enough Said...

SETUP
--
./install.pl

Answer all the quick questions, and you are done. install.pl will try the level
best to get the system parameters and hence most of the time it is best to use
the default options. Note the contents in the square brackets [] are the defaults
if you press enter without entering anything. These defaults are not the ones which
I choose, it is the ones which install.pl determines from your system.

If you use an unsupported shell (like the z shell). You need to find out all the 
parameters for that shell like: does aliases work like bash or c-shell?, where
is the user rc file? where is the system wide rc file? etc and try your luck.
If things fail, you need to make a manual install: copy trsh.pl to wherever you 
want, put that in the path, create aliases for rm and undo to point where you
have installed trsh. and finally copy the man page (trsh.1.gz).

Run uninstall.pl if you want to remove trsh completely from your system. 
(If you had performed a system wide install, please, run ./uninstall.pl
as root).

MANUAL INSTALLATION:
--
ok, Here is a manual installation procedure (These are followed by the scripts)
1. Copy trsh.pl to anywhere you like, 
2. If you want a manual entry, copy trsh.1.gz to /usr/share/man/man1 (Optional)
3. Make changes in your bashrc file (Local or global)
   Local changes affect only the current user and global changes affect ALL 
   users.
	a. The local rc file is usually in the home folder and named .bashrc 
	   (For bash and .cshrc for CSH and TCSH).
	b. The Global rc file is usually in the /etc folder named either as 
	   bash.bashrc or bashrc for bash and csh.cshrc or cshrc for CSH or
	   TCSH
	alias rm="/path/to/trsh.pl" # BASH
	alias undo="/path/to/trsh.pl -u" # BASH

	alias rm "/path/to/trsh.pl" # CSH/TCSH
	alias undo "/path/to/trsh.pl -u" # CSH/TCSH
If your Shell is not one of these, then refer to your shell's manual on how
to setup aliases. (If it is possible), or its alternatives. 

USAGE
--
rm [OPTIONS]... [FILES]...

FILES:
This is a list of files to recover or delete.

OPTIONS:

-u|--undo [FILES | REGEX]
If this option is provided without any other arguments, the latest deleted file will be restored.
If FILE/FILES are provided, the latest copy of these (If they exist in the trash) is recovered
If instead a regex is provided, then all files in the trash matching with the regex is recovered. 
(For regex usage, refer the subsection on regex below)

-f|--force
This option instructs trsh to permanently delete FILES and completely bypass the trash

-i|--interactively
This option will instruct trsh to prompt the user before deleting each and every file.

-v|--verbose
This option will instruct trsh to talk about whatever it is doing.

-e|--empty
If this option is provided without any other arguments, Trash is emptied.
If FILE/FILES are provided, All copies of FILE is removed permanently from the trash
If instead a regex is provided, then all files in the trash matching with the regex is permanently removed.
(For regex usage, refer the subsection on regex below)

-r|--recursive
This option if provided will allow directories to be deleted.

-l|--list
This will display the contents of the trash.

-s|--size
This displays the size of the Trash directory. 
If provided with the -l option, The size of each trash entry will also be displayed.

-h|--human-readable
If provided with the -s option, the size will be printed in a human readable form.

--help
Displays this help and exits.

-x|--force-regex
This forces trsh to assume that the provided arguments are regex's. (Not needed most of the time, Read the REGEX Section)

rm FILES just moves FILES to the trash. By default, directories are not deleted.

REGEX
--
A regex is accepted for restoration and emptying the trash (refer -e and -u options above).
Currently only the * operator is accpeted. But as the shell tries to expand these, you will have
to escape the * by either putting the entire regex in quotes or escaping every instance of the *.
rm -u "some*"  # Correct
rm -r "some\*  # Correct
rm -u some*    # Wrong

The -x option is probably going to be the least used. Here is one of the scenarios where it might be useful:
touch test1 te\*t1
rm test1 te\*t1
rm -u "te\*t1"    # This will restore only te\*t1.
rm -ux "te\*t1"   # This will restore both test1 and te\*t1.
But rm -u "te*" will still restore both.


NOTES
--

If multiple files of the same name are deleted, they are stored in the trash as if it were a stack.
Thus any recover will be like popping the files from the trash stack! 

TEST
--

Note, these scripts are only present in the svn version (If you do an svn checkout).
But I have removed them from the downloadable version. Now a days  I make sure to run these
tests before creating a downloadable tar on both csh and bash and hence is not necessary
for the user to run them.

BASH: test-trsh.bash
CSH/TCSH: test-trsh.csh

NOTE: If you really want to use the svn snapshot, then please stick to the revision 
I have made avaliable for download!
